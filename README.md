# React-Scoreboard

##summery<br/>
The Scoreboard app is one of the first web applications I built using react after learning about the frame work.
It was a tutorial so the idea was not my own. This app used props to pass information to and from react components to use in different parts of the app.
State was also used in the app to keep track and change player information in multiple components in the app.
